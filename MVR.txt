To update first name, middle name and last name we have four scenarios.

Scenario 1 - Comma rule
-----------------------

If you have comma in the driver's name then the rule did applies.
The comma rule says the name before comma is the last name and after comma it is first name followed by the middle name.

First Name	Middle Name	Last Name

Donald	       Kennith Levi	 Benson

 First Name	 Middle Name	Last Name
-----------      -----------    ---------
   Donald       Kennith Levi    Benson

Scenario 2- Without Comma Rule
------------------------------

If there is no comma in the driver’s name go to the reference document then refer then refer to page number 4 in the document and as per the state the name will apply.
Example: Thomas Bruce Allen


First Name	Middle Name	Last Name

Thomas	         Bruce	          Allen

  First Name	 	Middle Name		Last Name
  ---------             -----------             ---------
    Thomas		   Bruce		  Allen

Scenario 3- Suffix Rule
-----------------------

The suffix has to be updated along with the last name separated by a comma followed by a space.
Example: Benson Donald Kennith Jr

First Name	Middle Name	Last Name
Benson	Donald	Kennith, Jr

Scenario 4- Middle Name Rule
----------------------------

If first and last name are different from the other drivers name in the list, then have to update the first letter of the middle name.
Example:

First Name   Middle Name   Last Name
Thomas	       Bruce	    Allen

Benson	      Donald	    Levi
David	       Mark	   Cooper
David	       Lee	   Cooper

If first and last name are same as other drivers in the list then update full middle name

First Name        Middle Name        Last Name
----------        -----------        ---------
Thomas	               B	       Allen
Benson	               D	       Levi
David	             Mark	       Cooper
